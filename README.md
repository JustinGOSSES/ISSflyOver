# ISSflyOver
testing ground for open_notify API and Leaflet.js map that was used in this wordpress blog post - http://justingosses.com/issflyover/

The closest to the used version of code is in the folder. ISSflyOverSmall

The future plan is another blog post that combines this lat / long data with other APIs. 
For example, what is the closest restuarant with a good review directly under the ISS right now?
